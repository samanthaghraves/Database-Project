#LOGS ANALYSIS PROJECT#

Hey everyone!

So, this one is a bit of a doozy. This program reads a posgresql database via Python, and then prints out pieces of information based on the questions asked in the project.

###So let's get started!###

In this repo, you'll find 3 files.

First, the README. It's awesome, and you are here.

Next up, there's the questions.py file. Thats where the _magic_ happens!

In that file, you will find some code. I'll go over the classes and explain how stuff works. 

First, the queries are actually seperate and standalone items. 

Then, def get_query_result runs the string through the system, allowing it to be processed.

After that, def print_query_results checks the stored results, and formats and prints
them to the screen.

Just like magic yah.

The last file in this repo is questions.txt, which is just a txt file that shows the output.

Hope you like it!
